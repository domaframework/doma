Introduction
============

The Unified Criteria API provides a clear and intuitive interface
by integrating the Entityql and NativeSql DSLs from the :doc:`criteria-api`.

The following entity classes are used in the examples below:

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(metamodel = @Metamodel)
    public class Employee {

      @Id private Integer employeeId;
      private Integer employeeNo;
      private String employeeName;
      private Integer managerId;
      private LocalDate hiredate;
      private Salary salary;
      private Integer departmentId;
      private Integer addressId;
      @Version private Integer version;
      @OriginalStates private Employee states;
      @Association private Department department;
      @Association private Employee manager;
      @Association private Address address;

      // getters and setters
    }

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(metamodel = @Metamodel)
    public class Department {

      @Id private Integer departmentId;
      private Integer departmentNo;
      private String departmentName;
      private String location;
      @Version private Integer version;
      @OriginalStates private Department originalStates;
      @Association private List<Employee> employeeList = new ArrayList<>();

      // getters and setters
    }

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(immutable = true, metamodel = @Metamodel)
    @Table(name = "EMPLOYEE")
    public class Emp {

      @Id private final Integer employeeId;
      private final Integer employeeNo;
      private final String employeeName;
      private final Integer managerId;
      private final LocalDate hiredate;
      private final Salary salary;
      private final Integer departmentId;
      private final Integer addressId;
      @Version private final Integer version;
      @Association private final Dept department;
      @Association private final Emp manager;

      // constructor and getters
    }

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(immutable = true, metamodel = @Metamodel)
    @Table(name = "DEPARTMENT")
    public class Dept {

      @Id private final Integer departmentId;
      private final Integer departmentNo;
      private final String departmentName;
      private final String location;
      @Version private final Integer version;

      // constructor and getters
    }

The ``@Entity(metamodel = @Metamodel)`` annotation on these classes instructs Doma's annotation processor
to generate corresponding metamodel classes that enable type-safe query creation.

In our examples, the generated metamodel classes are ``Employee_``, ``Department_``, ``Emp_``, and ``Dept_``.

You can customize the metamodel names using the elements of the `Metamodel` annotation.

To bulk customize all metamodels, you can use annotation processor options.
See :doc:`annotation-processing` and refer to the following options:

* doma.metamodel.enabled
* doma.metamodel.prefix
* doma.metamodel.suffix

Query DSL
---------

The Unified Criteria API is essentially the Query DSL.

The Query DSL can execute entity queries and associations.
The entry point is the ``org.seasar.doma.jdbc.criteria.QueryDsl`` class.
This class includes the following methods:

* from
* insert
* delete
* update

Instantiate the ``QueryDsl`` class as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    QueryDsl queryDsl = new QueryDsl(config);

For example, to query ``Employee`` and ``Department`` entities and associate them, use:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Employee> list =
        queryDsl
            .from(e)
            .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
            .where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentName, "SALES"))
            .associate(
                e,
                d,
                (employee, department) -> {
                  employee.setDepartment(department);
                  department.getEmployeeList().add(employee);
                })
            .fetch();

The query above generates the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID,
    t0_.HIREDATE, t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION,
    t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t1_.LOCATION, t1_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_ inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)
    where t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = ?

.. note::

    In Kotlin, use ``org.seasar.doma.kotlin.jdbc.criteria.KQueryDsl`` instead of ``QueryDsl``.
    ``KQueryDsl`` is included in the doma-kotlin module.
    See :ref:`kotlin-specific-criteria-api`.

Select Statement
================

Select Settings
---------------

We support the following settings:

* allowEmptyWhere
* comment
* fetchSize
* maxRows
* queryTimeout
* sqlLogType

All of these settings are optional and can be applied as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl.from(e, settings -> {
      settings.setAllowEmptyWhere(false);
      settings.setComment("all employees");
      settings.setFetchSize(100);
      settings.setMaxRows(100);
      settings.setSqlLogType(SqlLogType.RAW);
      settings.setQueryTimeout(1000);
    }).fetch();

Fetching
--------

The Query DSL provides the following data-fetching methods:

* fetch
* fetchOne
* fetchOptional
* stream

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    // The fetch method returns results as a list.
    List<Employee> list = queryDsl.from(e).fetch();

    // The fetchOne method returns a single result, possibly null.
    Employee employee = queryDsl.from(e).where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 1)).fetchOne();

    // The fetchOptional method returns a single result as an Optional object.
    Optional<Employee> optional = queryDsl.from(e).where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 1)).fetchOptional();

    // The stream method returns results as a stream.
    Stream<Employee> stream = queryDsl.from(e).stream();

Streaming
---------

The Query DSL supports the following stream-handling methods:

* mapStream
* collect
* openStream

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    // mapStream allows processing of a stream.
    Map<Integer, List<Employee>> map = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .mapStream(stream -> stream.collect(groupingBy(Employee::getDepartmentId)));

    // collect is a shorthand for mapStream.
    Map<Integer, List<Employee>> map2 = queryDsl.from(e).collect(groupingBy(Employee::getDepartmentId));

    // openStream returns a stream. You MUST close the stream explicitly.
    try (Stream<Employee> stream = queryDsl.from(e).openStream()) {
        stream.forEach(employee -> {
            // do something
        });
    }

These methods provide efficient processing for large result sets.

Select Expression
-----------------

Entity Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the result entity type is the same as the type specified in the ``from`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .fetch();

The above query generates the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID,
    t0_.HIREDATE, t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)

To choose a joined entity type as the result entity type, use ``project`` or ``select``:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Department> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .project(d)
        .fetch();

This query generates the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t1_.LOCATION, t1_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)

.. note::

    The ``project`` method removes duplicate entities, while ``select`` does not.
    If you call neither method, duplicates are removed by default.

Multiple Entity Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify multiple entity types and fetch them as tuples:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Tuple2<Department, Employee>> list = queryDsl
        .from(d)
        .leftJoin(e, on -> on.eq(d.departmentId, e.departmentId))
        .where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentId, 4))
        .select(d, e)
        .fetch();

This query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION,
    t0_.VERSION, t1_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t1_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t1_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t1_.MANAGER_ID,
    t1_.HIREDATE, t1_.SALARY, t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t1_.ADDRESS_ID, t1_.VERSION
    from DEPARTMENT t0_ left outer join EMPLOYEE t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)
    where t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = ?

In the tuple, an entity is null if all its properties are null.

.. note::

    The ``select`` method does not remove duplicates.

Column Projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To project columns, use ``select``. For one column:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<String> list = queryDsl.from(e).select(e.employeeName).fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME from EMPLOYEE t0_

For multiple columns:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Tuple2<String, Integer>> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .select(e.employeeName, e.employeeNo)
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO from EMPLOYEE t0_

Columns up to 9 are held in ``Tuple2`` to ``Tuple9``. Beyond that, they are held in ``Row``.

Use ``selectAsRow`` for a ``Row`` list:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Row> list = queryDsl.from(e).selectAsRow(e.employeeName, e.employeeNo).fetch();

Column Projection and Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To project columns and map them to an entity, use the ``projectTo`` or ``selectTo`` methods:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl.from(e).selectTo(e, e.employeeName).fetch();

This query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME from EMPLOYEE t0_

Note that the SQL select clause includes the primary key "EMPLOYEE_ID". The ``projectTo`` and ``selectTo`` methods always include the entity's ID properties, even if they aren't explicitly specified.

.. note::

    The ``projectTo`` method removes duplicate entity IDs from the results, while ``selectTo`` does not.

.. _query_dsl_where:

Where Expression
----------------

The following operators and predicates are supported:

* eq - (=)
* ne - (<>)
* ge - (>=)
* gt - (>)
* le - (<=)
* lt - (<)
* isNull - (is null)
* isNotNull - (is not null)
* like
* notLike - (not like)
* between
* in
* notIn - (not in)
* exists
* notExists - (not exists)

.. note::

    If the right-hand operand is ``null``, the WHERE or HAVING clause will exclude the operator. See `WhereDeclaration`_ and `HavingDeclaration`_ javadoc for details.

.. _WhereDeclaration: https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.seasar.doma/doma-core/latest/org/seasar/doma/jdbc/criteria/declaration/WhereDeclaration.html
.. _HavingDeclaration: https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.seasar.doma/doma-core/latest/org/seasar/doma/jdbc/criteria/declaration/HavingDeclaration.html

We also support utility operators:

* eqOrIsNull - ("=" or "is null")
* neOrIsNotNull - ("<>" or "is not null")

Additionally, the following logical operators are supported:

* and
* or
* not

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .where(c -> {
            c.eq(e.departmentId, 2);
            c.isNotNull(e.managerId);
            c.or(() -> {
                c.gt(e.salary, new Salary("1000"));
                c.lt(e.salary, new Salary("2000"));
            });
        })
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    where t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = ? and t0_.MANAGER_ID is not null or (t0_.SALARY > ? and t0_.SALARY < ?)

Subqueries can be written as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Employee_ e2 = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .where(c -> c.in(e.employeeId, c.from(e2).select(e2.managerId)))
        .orderBy(c -> c.asc(e.employeeId))
        .fetch();

The above query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    where t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID in (select t1_.MANAGER_ID from EMPLOYEE t1_)
    order by t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID asc

Dynamic Where Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A WHERE expression uses only evaluated operators to build a WHERE clause. When no operators are evaluated in the expression, the statement omits the WHERE clause.

For example, with a conditional expression:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .where(c -> {
            c.eq(e.departmentId, 1);
            if (enableNameCondition) {
                c.like(e.employeeName, name);
            }
        })
        .fetch();

If ``enableNameCondition`` is ``false``, the ``like`` expression is ignored, generating:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = ?

Join Expression
---------------

We support the following join expressions:

* innerJoin - (inner join)
* leftJoin - (left outer join)

Example for innerJoin:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)

Example for leftJoin:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .leftJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    left outer join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)

.. _query_dsl_associate:

Association
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can associate entities using the ``associate`` operation in conjunction with a join expression:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentName, "SALES"))
        .associate(
            e,
            d,
            (employee, department) -> {
              employee.setDepartment(department);
              department.getEmployeeList().add(employee);
            })
        .fetch();

This query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID,
    t0_.HIREDATE, t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION,
    t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t1_.LOCATION, t1_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_ inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)
    where t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = ?

Associating Multiple Entities:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();
    Address_ a = new Address_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .innerJoin(a, on -> on.eq(e.addressId, a.addressId))
        .where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentName, "SALES"))
        .associate(
            e,
            d,
            (employee, department) -> {
              employee.setDepartment(department);
              department.getEmployeeList().add(employee);
            })
        .associate(e, a, Employee::setAddress)
        .fetch();

Associating Immutable Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To associate immutable entities, use the ``associateWith`` operation with a join expression:

.. code-block:: java

    Emp_ e = new Emp_();
    Emp_ m = new Emp_();
    Dept_ d = new Dept_();

    List<Emp> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .leftJoin(m, on -> on.eq(e.managerId, m.employeeId))
        .where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentName, "SALES"))
        .associateWith(e, d, Emp::withDept)
        .associateWith(e, m, Emp::withManager)
        .fetch();

This query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION,
    t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t1_.LOCATION, t1_.VERSION,
    t2_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t2_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t2_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t2_.MANAGER_ID, t2_.HIREDATE,
    t2_.SALARY, t2_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t2_.ADDRESS_ID, t2_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)
    left outer join EMPLOYEE t2_ on (t0_.MANAGER_ID = t2_.EMPLOYEE_ID)
    where t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = ?

Dynamic Join Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A join expression uses only evaluated operators to build a JOIN clause. When no operators are evaluated, the JOIN clause is omitted.

For example, with a conditional join:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Employee_ e2 = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(e2, on -> {
            if (join) {
                on.eq(e.managerId, e2.employeeId);
            }
        })
        .fetch();

If ``join`` is ``false``, the ``on`` expression is ignored, generating:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_

Dynamic Association
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With dynamic join expressions, associations can be made optional. Use ``AssociationOption.optional()`` in the ``associate`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> {
            if (join) {
                on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId);
            }
        })
        .associate(
            e,
            d,
            (employee, department) -> {
              employee.setDepartment(department);
              department.getEmployeeList().add(employee);
            },
            AssociationOption.optional())
        .fetch();

Aggregate Functions
-------------------

The following aggregate functions are supported:

* avg(property)
* avgAsDouble(property)
* count()
* count(property)
* countDistinct(property)
* max(property)
* min(property)
* sum(property)

These functions are defined in the ``org.seasar.doma.jdbc.criteria.expression.Expressions`` class and can be used with static imports.

For example, to pass the ``sum`` function to the select method:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    Salary salary = queryDsl.from(e).select(sum(e.salary)).fetchOne();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select sum(t0_.SALARY) from EMPLOYEE t0_

Group By Expression
-------------------

Group by expressions allow for grouping results based on specified columns:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Tuple2<Integer, Long>> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .groupBy(e.departmentId)
        .select(e.departmentId, count())
        .fetch();

The above code generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, count(*) from EMPLOYEE t0_ group by t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID

When a group by expression is not specified, the expression is inferred from the select expression automatically. Thus, the following code issues the same SQL as above:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Tuple2<Integer, Long>> list = queryDsl.from(e).select(e.departmentId, count()).fetch();

Having Expression
-----------------

The following operators are supported in having expressions:

* eq - (=)
* ne - (<>)
* ge - (>=)
* gt - (>)
* le - (<=)
* lt - (<)

Logical operators are also supported:

* and
* or
* not

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Tuple2<Long, String>> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .having(c -> c.gt(count(), 3L))
        .orderBy(c -> c.asc(count()))
        .select(count(), d.departmentName)
        .fetch();

The above query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select count(*), t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    inner join DEPARTMENT t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)
    group by t1_.DEPARTMENT_NAME having count(*) > ?
    order by count(*) asc

Dynamic Having Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A having expression includes only evaluated operators, omitting the HAVING clause if no operators are evaluated.

For instance, a conditional expression in a having clause:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Tuple2<Long, String>> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .groupBy(d.departmentName)
        .having(c -> {
            if (countCondition) {
                c.gt(count(), 3L);
            }
        })
        .select(count(), d.departmentName)
        .fetch();

If ``countCondition`` is ``false``, the ``having`` clause is ignored in the SQL statement.

Order By Expression
-------------------

Supported ordering operations are:

* asc
* desc

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .orderBy(c -> {
            c.asc(e.departmentId);
            c.desc(e.salary);
        })
        .fetch();

The query above generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    order by t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID asc, t0_.SALARY desc

Dynamic Order By Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Order by expressions use only evaluated operators to build the ORDER BY clause. When no operators are evaluated, the ORDER BY clause is omitted.

Distinct Expression
-------------------

To select distinct rows, use ``distinct()``:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Department> list = queryDsl
        .from(d)
        .distinct()
        .leftJoin(e, on -> on.eq(d.departmentId, e.departmentId))
        .fetch();

This query generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select distinct t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME,
    t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION
    from DEPARTMENT t0_
    left outer join EMPLOYEE t1_ on (t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID)

Limit and Offset Expression
---------------------------

To limit the number of rows and specify an offset:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .limit(5)
        .offset(3)
        .orderBy(c -> c.asc(e.employeeNo))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    order by t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO asc
    offset 3 rows fetch first 5 rows only

Dynamic Limit and Offset Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limit and offset expressions include only non-null values in the SQL. If either value is null, the corresponding FETCH FIRST or OFFSET clause is omitted.

For Update Expression
---------------------

The ``forUpdate`` method allows row locking in SQL:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    List<Employee> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 1))
        .forUpdate()
        .fetch();

The query above generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    where t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID = ?
    for update

Union Expression
----------------

Supported union operations include:

* union
* unionAll - (union all)

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    List<Tuple2<Integer, String>> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .select(e.employeeId, e.employeeName)
        .union(queryDsl.from(d)
            .select(d.departmentId, d.departmentName))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME from EMPLOYEE t0_
    union
    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME from DEPARTMENT t0_

Using order by with an index in union queries:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Tuple2<Integer, String>> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .select(e.employeeId, e.employeeName)
        .union(queryDsl.from(d)
            .select(d.departmentId, d.departmentName))
        .orderBy(c -> c.asc(2))
        .fetch();

Derived Table Expression
------------------------

Subqueries using derived tables are supported. A corresponding entity class for the derived table is required.

Define the entity class for the derived table as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(metamodel = @Metamodel)
    public class NameAndAmount {
      private String name;
      private Integer amount;

      public NameAndAmount() {}

      public NameAndAmount(String accounting, BigDecimal bigDecimal) {
        this.name = accounting;
        this.amount = bigDecimal.intValue();
      }

      public String getName() { return name; }
      public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
      public Integer getAmount() { return amount; }
      public void setAmount(Integer amount) { this.amount = amount; }

      @Override
      public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        NameAndAmount that = (NameAndAmount) o;
        return Objects.equals(name, that.name) && Objects.equals(amount, that.amount);
      }

      @Override
      public int hashCode() { return Objects.hash(name, amount); }
    }

A subquery using a derived table can be written as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    Department_ d = new Department_();
    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    NameAndAmount_ t = new NameAndAmount_();

    SetOperand<?> subquery = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .innerJoin(d, c -> c.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
        .groupBy(d.departmentName)
        .select(d.departmentName, Expressions.sum(e.salary));

    List<NameAndAmount> list = queryDsl
        .from(t, subquery)
        .orderBy(c -> c.asc(t.name))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select 
        t0_.NAME, 
        t0_.AMOUNT 
    from 
        (
            select 
                t2_.DEPARTMENT_NAME AS NAME, 
                sum(t1_.SALARY) AS AMOUNT 
            from 
                EMPLOYEE t1_ 
            inner join 
                DEPARTMENT t2_ on (t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t2_.DEPARTMENT_ID) 
            group by 
                t2_.DEPARTMENT_NAME
        ) t0_ 
    order by 
        t0_.NAME asc

Common Table Expression
-----------------------

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are supported.
To use a CTE, a corresponding entity class must be defined.

Define the entity class for the CTE as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(metamodel = @Metamodel)
    public record AverageSalary(Salary salary) {}

A query using the CTE can be written as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    var a = new AverageSalary_();
    var e = new Employee_();

    var cteQuery =
        dsl.from(e)
            .select(Expressions.avg(e.salary));

    var list =
        dsl.with(a, cteQuery)
            .from(e)
            .innerJoin(a, on -> on.ge(e.salary, a.salary))
            .select(e.employeeId, e.employeeName, e.salary)
            .fetch();

The above query generates the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    with AVERAGE_SALARY(SALARY) as (
        select
            avg(t0_.SALARY)
        from 
            EMPLOYEE t0_
    )
    select
        t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID,
        t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME,
        t0_.SALARY from EMPLOYEE t0_
    inner join
        AVERAGE_SALARY t1_ on (t0_.SALARY >= t1_.SALARY)

Delete Statement
================

The delete statement follows the same rules as the :ref:`query_dsl_where`.

Delete Settings
---------------

The following settings are supported:

* allowEmptyWhere
* batchSize
* comment
* ignoreVersion
* queryTimeout
* sqlLogType
* suppressOptimisticLockException

All are optional and can be applied as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    int count = queryDsl.delete(e, settings -> {
      settings.setAllowEmptyWhere(true);
      settings.setBatchSize(20);
      settings.setComment("delete all");
      settings.setIgnoreVersion(true);
      settings.setQueryTimeout(1000);
      settings.setSqlLogType(SqlLogType.RAW);
      settings.setSuppressOptimisticLockException(true);
    })
    .where(c -> {})
    .execute();

.. note::

    To allow a delete statement with an empty WHERE clause, enable the ``allowEmptyWhere`` setting.

Delete Record by Entity
-----------------------

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    Employee employee = queryDsl.from(e).where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 5)).fetchOne();

    Result<Employee> result = queryDsl.delete(e).single(employee).execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    delete from EMPLOYEE where EMPLOYEE_ID = ? and VERSION = ?

Batch Delete is also supported:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Employee> employees = queryDsl.from(e).where(c -> c.in(e.employeeId, Arrays.asList(5, 6))).fetch();

    BatchResult<Employee> result = queryDsl.delete(e).batch(employees).execute();

Exceptions thrown by the execute method include:

* OptimisticLockException: if the entity has a version property and an update count is 0

Delete Record by Entity and Retrieve the Deleted Record
----------------------------------------------------------

By calling the ``returning`` method, you can delete an entity and retrieve the deleted entity at the same time:

.. code-block:: java

    Department result = queryDsl.delete(d).single(department).returning().fetchOne();

This generates the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    delete from DEPARTMENT where DEPARTMENT_ID = ? and VERSION = ?
    returning DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION

You can also specify which properties to return in the ``returning`` method.

To receive the result as an ``Optional``, use the ``fetchOptional`` method instead of ``fetchOne``.

.. note::

  Only H2 Database, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite Dialects support this feature.

Delete Records by Where Expression
----------------------------------

To delete by a condition:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl.delete(e).where(c -> c.ge(e.salary, new Salary("2000"))).execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    delete from EMPLOYEE t0_ where t0_.SALARY >= ?

To delete all records, use the ``all`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl.delete(e).all().execute();

Insert Statement
================

If a unique constraint violation occurs during the execution of an insert statement,
a ``UniqueConstraintException`` will be thrown.

Insert Settings
---------------

Supported insert settings include:

* comment
* queryTimeout
* sqlLogType
* batchSize
* excludeNull
* include
* exclude
* ignoreGeneratedKeys

All are optional and can be applied as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    Department_ d = new Department_();

    int count = queryDsl.insert(d, settings -> {
        settings.setComment("insert department");
        settings.setQueryTimeout(1000);
        settings.setSqlLogType(SqlLogType.RAW);
        settings.setBatchSize(20);
        settings.excludeNull(true);
    })
    .values(c -> {
        c.value(d.departmentId, 99);
        c.value(d.departmentNo, 99);
        c.value(d.departmentName, "aaa");
        c.value(d.location, "bbb");
        c.value(d.version, 1);
    })
    .execute();

You can specify excluded columns:

.. code-block:: java

    Department department = ...;

    Result<Department> result = queryDsl.insert(d, settings -> 
        settings.exclude(d.departmentName, d.location)
    ).single(department).execute();

Insert Record with Entity
-------------------------

single
~~~~~~

Inserting a single entity:

.. code-block:: java

    Department department = new Department();
    department.setDepartmentId(99);
    department.setDepartmentNo(99);
    department.setDepartmentName("aaa");
    department.setLocation("bbb");

    Result<Department> result = queryDsl.insert(d).single(department).execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into DEPARTMENT (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION)
    values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)


Functionality equivalent to ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`` is supported.

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyUpdate`` method to update the existing record when a duplicate key is found:

.. code-block:: java

    Result<Department> = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .single(department)
        .onDuplicateKeyUpdate()
        .execute();

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyIgnore`` method when you want to do nothing in case of a duplicate key:

.. code-block:: java

    Result<Department> = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .single(department)
        .onDuplicateKeyIgnore()
        .execute();

batch
~~~~~

Batch Insert is also supported:

.. code-block:: java

    Department department = ...;
    Department department2 = ...;
    List<Department> departments = Arrays.asList(department, department2);

    BatchResult<Department> result = queryDsl.insert(d).batch(departments).execute();

Functionality equivalent to ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`` is supported.

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyUpdate`` method to update existing records when duplicate keys are found:

.. code-block:: java

    BatchResult<Department> = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .batch(departments)
        .onDuplicateKeyUpdate()
        .execute();

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyIgnore`` method to skip the insert operation when a duplicate key is found:

.. code-block:: java

    BatchResult<Department> = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .batch(departments)
        .onDuplicateKeyIgnore()
        .execute();

multi
~~~~~

Multi-row Insert is also supported:

.. code-block:: java

    MultiResult<Department> result = queryDsl.insert(d).multi(departments).execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into DEPARTMENT (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION)
    values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?), (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

Functionality equivalent to ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`` is supported.

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyUpdate`` method to update existing records when duplicate keys are found:

.. code-block:: java

    MultiResult<Department> = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .multi(departments)
        .onDuplicateKeyUpdate()
        .execute();

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyIgnore`` method to skip insert operations when duplicate keys are found:

.. code-block:: java

    MultiResult<Department> = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .multi(departments)
        .onDuplicateKeyIgnore()
        .execute();

Insert Record with Entity and Retrieve the Inserted Record
----------------------------------------------------------

By calling the ``returning`` method, you can insert an entity and retrieve the inserted entity at the same time:

.. code-block:: java

    Department result = queryDsl.insert(d).single(department).returning().fetchOne();

This generates the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into DEPARTMENT (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION)
    values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) returning DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION

You can also specify which properties to return in the ``returning`` method.

To receive the result as an ``Optional``, use the ``fetchOptional`` method instead of ``fetchOne``.

The ``returning`` method is also supported for multi-row inserts.
In that case, the ``fetch`` method returns a List of inserted entities:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Department> results = queryDsl.insert(d).multi(departmentList).returning().fetch();

.. note::

  Only H2 Database, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite Dialects support this feature.

Insert Record with Specified Values
-----------------------------------

Inserting records by specifying values:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl.insert(d)
        .values(c -> {
            c.value(d.departmentId, 99);
            c.value(d.departmentNo, 99);
            c.value(d.departmentName, "aaa");
            c.value(d.location, "bbb");
            c.value(d.version, 1);
        })
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into DEPARTMENT (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION)
    values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

We also support the INSERT SELECT syntax:

.. code-block:: java

    Department_ da = new Department_("DEPARTMENT_ARCHIVE");
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    int count = queryDsl.insert(da)
        .select(c -> c.from(d).where(cc -> cc.in(d.departmentId, Arrays.asList(1, 2))))
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into DEPARTMENT_ARCHIVE (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME,
    LOCATION, VERSION) select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME,
    t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID in (?, ?)

Functionality equivalent to ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`` is supported.

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyUpdate`` method when you want to perform an update in case of a duplicate key:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .values(c -> {
            c.value(d.departmentId, 1);
            c.value(d.departmentNo, 60);
            c.value(d.departmentName, "DEVELOPMENT");
            c.value(d.location, "KYOTO");
            c.value(d.version, 2);
        })
        .onDuplicateKeyUpdate()
        .keys(d.departmentId)
        .set(c -> {
            c.value(d.departmentName, c.excluded(d.departmentName));
            c.value(d.location, "KYOTO");
            c.value(d.version, 3);
        })
        .execute();

Use the ``onDuplicateKeyIgnore`` method to skip insert operations when duplicate keys are found:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl
        .insert(d)
        .values(c -> {
            c.value(d.departmentId, 1);
            c.value(d.departmentNo, 60);
            c.value(d.departmentName, "DEVELOPMENT");
            c.value(d.location, "KYOTO");
            c.value(d.version, 2);
        })
        .onDuplicateKeyIgnore()
        .keys(d.departmentId)
        .execute();

Update Statement
================

If a unique constraint violation occurs during the execution of an update statement,
a ``UniqueConstraintException`` will be thrown.

The update statement follows the same specifications as the :ref:`query_dsl_where`.

Update Settings
---------------

The following settings are supported:

* allowEmptyWhere
* batchSize
* comment
* ignoreVersion
* queryTimeout
* sqlLogType
* suppressOptimisticLockException
* excludeNull
* include
* exclude

All are optional and can be applied as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();

    int count = queryDsl.update(e, settings -> {
      settings.setAllowEmptyWhere(true);
      settings.setBatchSize(20);
      settings.setComment("update all");
      settings.setIgnoreVersion(true);
      settings.setQueryTimeout(1000);
      settings.setSqlLogType(SqlLogType.RAW);
      settings.setSuppressOptimisticLockException(true);
      settings.excludeNull(true);
    }).set(c -> {
      c.value(e.employeeName, "aaa");
    }).execute();

You can also specify excluded columns:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee employee = ...;

    Result<Employee> result = queryDsl.update(e, settings -> 
        settings.exclude(e.hiredate, e.salary)
    ).single(employee).execute();

.. note::

    To perform an update without a WHERE clause, enable the ``allowEmptyWhere`` setting.

Update Record by Entity
-----------------------

Updating a single entity:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee employee = queryDsl.from(e).where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 5)).fetchOne();
    employee.setEmployeeName("aaa");
    employee.setSalary(new Salary("2000"));

    Result<Employee> result = queryDsl.update(e).single(employee).execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    update EMPLOYEE set EMPLOYEE_NAME = ?, SALARY = ?, VERSION = ? + 1
    where EMPLOYEE_ID = ? and VERSION = ?

Batch Update is also supported:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee employee = ...;
    Employee employee2 = ...;
    List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(employee, employee2);

    BatchResult<Employee> result = queryDsl.update(e).batch(employees).execute();

Exceptions from the execute method may include:

* OptimisticLockException: if the entity has a version property and the update count is 0

Update Record by Entity and Retrieve the Updated Record
----------------------------------------------------------

By calling the ``returning`` method, you can update an entity and retrieve the updated entity at the same time:

.. code-block:: java

    Department result = queryDsl.update(d).single(department).returning().fetchOne();

This generates the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    update DEPARTMENT set DEPARTMENT_NO = ?, DEPARTMENT_NAME = ?, LOCATION = ?, VERSION = ? + 1
    where DEPARTMENT_ID = ? and VERSION = ?
    returning DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION, VERSION

You can also specify which properties to return in the ``returning`` method.

To receive the result as an ``Optional``, use the ``fetchOptional`` method instead of ``fetchOne``.

.. note::

  Only H2 Database, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite Dialects support this feature.

Update Records by Where Expression
----------------------------------

To update records based on a condition:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl.update(e)
        .set(c -> c.value(e.departmentId, 3))
        .where(c -> {
            c.isNotNull(e.managerId);
            c.ge(e.salary, new Salary("2000"));
        })
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    update EMPLOYEE t0_ set t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = ?
    where t0_.MANAGER_ID is not null and t0_.SALARY >= ?

Property Expressions
====================

All property expression methods are in the ``org.seasar.doma.jdbc.criteria.expression.Expressions`` class and can be used with static imports.

Arithmetic Expressions
----------------------

The following methods are available for arithmetic expressions:

* add - (+)
* sub - (-)
* mul - (*)
* div - (/)
* mod - (%)

Example of using the ``add`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl.update(e)
        .set(c -> c.value(e.version, add(e.version, 10)))
        .where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 1))
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    update EMPLOYEE t0_
    set t0_.VERSION = (t0_.VERSION + ?)
    where t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID = ?

String Functions
----------------

The following string functions are provided:

* concat
* lower
* upper
* trim
* ltrim
* rtrim

Example using ``concat``:

.. code-block:: java

    int count = queryDsl.update(e)
        .set(c -> c.value(e.employeeName, concat("[", concat(e.employeeName, "]"))))
        .where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 1))
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    update EMPLOYEE t0_
    set t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME = concat(?, concat(t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, ?))
    where t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID = ?

Literal Expression
------------------

The ``literal`` method supports all basic data types.

Example of using ``literal``:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee employee = queryDsl.from(e)
        .where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, literal(1)))
        .fetchOne();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, t0_.MANAGER_ID, t0_.HIREDATE,
    t0_.SALARY, t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.VERSION
    from EMPLOYEE t0_
    where t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID = 1

.. note::

    Note that literal expressions are directly embedded in the SQL rather than being treated as bind variables.

Case Expression
---------------

The following method is supported for case expressions:

* when

Example of using ``when``:

.. code-block:: java

    List<String> list = queryDsl
        .from(e)
        .select(
            when(c -> {
                c.eq(e.employeeName, literal("SMITH"), lower(e.employeeName));
                c.eq(e.employeeName, literal("KING"), lower(e.employeeName));
            }, literal("_")))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select case
            when t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME = 'SMITH' then lower(t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME)
            when t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME = 'KING' then lower(t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME)
            else '_' end
    from EMPLOYEE t0_

Subquery Select Expression
--------------------------

The ``select`` method supports subquery select expressions.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: java

    Employee_ e = new Employee_();
    Employee_ e2 = new Employee_();
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    SelectExpression<Salary> subSelect = select(c -> 
        c.from(e2)
         .innerJoin(d, on -> on.eq(e2.departmentId, d.departmentId))
         .where(cc -> cc.eq(e.departmentId, d.departmentId))
         .groupBy(d.departmentId)
         .select(max(e2.salary))
    );

    int count = queryDsl.update(e)
        .set(c -> c.value(e.salary, subSelect))
        .where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, 1))
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    update EMPLOYEE t0_
    set t0_.SALARY = (
        select max(t1_.SALARY)
        from EMPLOYEE t1_
        inner join DEPARTMENT t2_ on (t1_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t2_.DEPARTMENT_ID)
        where t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID = t2_.DEPARTMENT_ID 
        group by t2_.DEPARTMENT_ID
    )
    where t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID = ?

User-Defined Expressions
------------------------

You can define user-defined expressions using ``Expressions.userDefined``.

Example of defining a custom ``replace`` function:

.. code-block:: java

    UserDefinedExpression<String> replace(PropertyMetamodel<String> expression, PropertyMetamodel<String> from, PropertyMetamodel<String> to) {
        return Expressions.userDefined(expression, "replace", from, to, c -> {
            c.appendSql("replace(");
            c.appendExpression(expression);
            c.appendSql(", ");
            c.appendExpression(from);
            c.appendSql(", ");
            c.appendExpression(to);
            c.appendSql(")");
        });
    }

Using the custom ``replace`` function in a query:

.. code-block:: java

    List<String> list = queryDsl
        .from(d)
        .select(replace(d.location, Expressions.literal("NEW"), Expressions.literal("new")))
        .fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select replace(t0_.LOCATION, 'NEW', 'new') from DEPARTMENT t0_

Scopes
======

Scopes allow you to specify commonly used query conditions.

To define a scope, create a class with a method annotated with ``@Scope``:

.. code-block:: java

    public class DepartmentScope {
        @Scope
        public Consumer<WhereDeclaration> onlyTokyo(Department_ d) {
            return c -> c.eq(d.location, "Tokyo");
        }
    }

To enable the scope, specify the scope class in the ``scopes`` element of ``@Metamodel``:

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(metamodel = @Metamodel(scopes = { DepartmentScope.class }))
    public class Department { ... }

Now ``Department_`` includes the ``onlyTokyo`` method, which can be used as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Department> list = queryDsl.from(d).where(d.onlyTokyo()).fetch();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_
    where t0_.LOCATION = ?

To combine other query conditions with scopes, use the ``andThen`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Department> list = queryDsl
        .from(d)
        .where(d.onlyTokyo().andThen(c -> c.gt(d.departmentNo, 50)))
        .fetch();

Defining multiple scopes within a class:

.. code-block:: java

    public class DepartmentScope {
        @Scope
        public Consumer<WhereDeclaration> onlyTokyo(Department_ d) {
            return c -> c.eq(d.location, "Tokyo");
        }

        @Scope
        public Consumer<WhereDeclaration> locationStartsWith(Department_ d, String prefix) {
            return c -> c.like(d.location, prefix, LikeOption.prefix());
        }

        @Scope
        public Consumer<OrderByNameDeclaration> sortByNo(Department_ d) {
            return c -> c.asc(d.departmentNo);
        }
    }

Tips
====

Execution in DAO
----------------

It can be useful to execute DSLs within a default method of the DAO interface.
To obtain a ``config`` object, call ``Config.get(this)`` within the default method:

.. code-block:: java

    @Dao
    public interface EmployeeDao {

      default Optional<Employee> selectById(Integer id) {
        QueryDsl queryDsl = new QueryDsl(Config.get(this));

        Employee_ e = new Employee_();
        return queryDsl.from(e).where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, id)).fetchOptional();
      }
    }

You can also use ``QueryDsl.of(this)`` as a shortcut for ``new QueryDsl(Config.get(this))``.

.. code-block:: java

    @Dao
    public interface EmployeeDao {

      default Optional<Employee> selectById(Integer id) {
        Employee_ e = new Employee_();
        return QueryDsl.of(this).from(e).where(c -> c.eq(e.employeeId, id)).fetchOptional();
      }
    }


Overwriting the Table Name
--------------------------

A metamodel constructor can accept a qualified table name, which allows the metamodel to overwrite its default table name.

This feature is useful for working with two tables that share the same structure:

.. code-block:: java

    Department_ da = new Department_("DEPARTMENT_ARCHIVE");
    Department_ d = new Department_();

    int count = queryDsl
        .insert(da)
        .select(c -> c.from(d))
        .execute();

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into DEPARTMENT_ARCHIVE (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NO, DEPARTMENT_NAME,
    LOCATION, VERSION) select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME,
    t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_

User-Defined Operators
----------------------

User-defined operators can be implemented as methods in a class that accepts a ``UserDefinedCriteriaContext`` instance via its constructor.

.. code-block:: java

    record MyExtension(UserDefinedCriteriaContext context) {
      public void regexp(PropertyMetamodel<String> propertyMetamodel, String regexp) {
        context.add(
            (b) -> {
              b.appendExpression(propertyMetamodel);
              b.appendSql(" ~ ");
              b.appendParameter(propertyMetamodel, regexp);
            });
      }
    }

The class above can be used in the WHERE, JOIN, or HAVING clause of a query as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    var d = new Department_();
    var list =
        queryDsl.from(d)
            .where(c -> c.extension(MyExtension::new, (ext) -> {
                ext.regexp(d.departmentName, "A");
            }))
            .orderBy(c -> c.asc(d.departmentId))
            .select()
            .fetch();

The query above is translated into the following SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_
    where t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME ~ ?
    order by t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID asc

Debugging
=========

To inspect the SQL statement generated by DSLs, use the ``asSql`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    Department_ d = new Department_();

    Listable<Department> stmt = queryDsl.from(d).where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentName, "SALES"));

    Sql<?> sql = stmt.asSql();
    System.out.printf("Raw SQL      : %s\n", sql.getRawSql());
    System.out.printf("Formatted SQL: %s\n", sql.getFormattedSql());

The code above outputs the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    Raw SQL      : select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = ?
    Formatted SQL: select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'SALES'

The ``asSql`` method does not execute the SQL statement against the database; instead, it only constructs the SQL statement and returns it as an ``Sql`` object.

You can also obtain the ``Sql`` object by using the ``peek`` method:

.. code-block:: java

    List<String> locations = queryDsl
        .from(d)
        .peek(System.out::println)
        .where(c -> c.eq(d.departmentName, "SALES"))
        .peek(System.out::println)
        .orderBy(c -> c.asc(d.location))
        .peek(sql -> System.out.println(sql.getFormattedSql()))
        .select(d.location)
        .peek(sql -> System.out.println(sql.getFormattedSql()))
        .fetch();

The code above outputs SQL statements at various stages of the query:

.. code-block:: sql

    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_
    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = ?
    select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NO, t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME, t0_.LOCATION, t0_.VERSION from DEPARTMENT t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'SALES' order by t0_.LOCATION asc
    select t0_.LOCATION from DEPARTMENT t0_ where t0_.DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'SALES' order by t0_.LOCATION asc
