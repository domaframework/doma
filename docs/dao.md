==================
# DAO interfaces

   :depth: 4

A Data Access Object (DAO) is an interface that provides structured access to databases.

# DAO definition

DAOs are defined as interfaces annotated with `@Dao`.

Implementation classes for the DAO interfaces are automatically generated by the annotation processor during compilation.

# Query definition

[\1](\1) can be defined using annotations.

You can use [\1](\1) or [\1](\1) in a [\1](\1) when you need to build queries dynamically in Java code.

# Default method

You can write Java code freely in default methods.

You can get the `Config` instance associated with a DAO instance by calling `Config.get` with the DAO instance as an argument.


```java

  @Dao
  public interface EmployeeDao {

      default int count() {
          Config config = Config.get(this);
          SelectBuilder builder = SelectBuilder.newInstance(config);
          builder.sql("select count(*) from employee");
          return builder.getScalarSingleResult(int.class);
      }
  }

# Example

Implementation classes are automatically generated by the annotation processor during compilation.
These implementation classes can be directly instantiated and used.
However, if the configuration class is managed by a Dependency Injection (DI) container, the DI container should control the instantiation of the implementation classes.

```java

  Config config = ...;
  EmployeeDao employeeDao = new EmployeeDaoImpl(config);
  Employee employee = employeeDao.selectById(1);

By default, the implementation class name is the interface name suffixed with `Impl`.
Please refer to [\1](\1) for information on how to customize the package name and suffix.

A DAO interface does not need to be defined in a one-to-one relationship with an entity class.
One DAO interface can handle multiple entity classes.

```java

  @Dao
  public interface MyDao {

      @Select
      Employee selectEmployeeById(int id);

      @Select
      Department selectDepartmentByName(String name);

      @Update
      int updateAddress(Address address);
  }
