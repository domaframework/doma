Aggregate strategies

The aggregate strategy defines how to construct an entity aggregate from an arbitrary SELECT statement.
It provides a structured way to map relational query results into hierarchical entity structures by specifying
how entities should be linked together.

Aggregate strategy definition
=============================

An aggregate strategy is defined by annotating an interface with ``@AggregateStrategy``.
This annotation specifies how an entity aggregate is reconstructed from a query result.

.. code-block:: java

    @AggregateStrategy(root = Department.class, tableAlias = "d")
    interface DepartmentAggregateStrategy {
        ...
    }

- The ``root`` element specifies the entity class that serves as the root of the aggregate.
- The ``tableAlias`` element defines the alias for the table corresponding to the root entity class.
  This alias must be used in the SELECT statement to correctly map query results to entity properties.

Association linker definition
===============================

An aggregate strategy must contain at least one field of type ``BiConsumer`` or ``BiFunction``,
annotated with ``@AssociationLinker``.
These functions are responsible for dynamically associating two entity instances.
Use a ``BiFunction`` when associating immutable entities.
For mutable entities, you may use either a ``BiConsumer`` or a ``BiFunction``.

.. code-block:: java

    @AggregateStrategy(root = Department.class, tableAlias = "d")
    interface DepartmentAggregateStrategy {
      @AssociationLinker(propertyPath = "employees", tableAlias = "e")
      BiConsumer<Department, Employee> employees =
          (d, e) -> {
            d.getEmployees().add(e);
            e.setDepartment(d);
          };

      @AssociationLinker(propertyPath = "employees.address", tableAlias = "a")
      BiFunction<Employee, Address, Employee> address =
          (e, a) -> {
            e.setAddress(a);
            return e;
          };
    }

- The first type parameter of a ``BiConsumer`` or ``BiFunction`` represents the type of the property owner,
  and the second type parameter represents the type of the property.
  The third type parameter of a ``BiFunction`` must be the same as the first one and represents the type of
  the entity after the association is applied.
- The ``propertyPath`` element specifies the name of the target property as a dot-separated path from the root entity class.
- The ``tableAlias`` element specifies the alias for the table corresponding to the entity class used as the second
  type parameter of the ``BiConsumer`` or ``BiFunction``. This alias must be used in the SELECT statement.

Example
================

The ``DepartmentAggregateStrategy`` described above is based on the following entity definitions:

.. code-block:: java

    @Entity(naming = NamingType.SNAKE_LOWER_CASE)
    public class Department {
      @Id Integer id;
      String name;
      @Association List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

      // getter, setter
    }

    @Entity(naming = NamingType.SNAKE_LOWER_CASE)
    public class Employee {
      @Id Integer id;
      String name;
      Integer departmentId;
      Integer addressId;
      @Association Department department;
      @Association Address address;

      // getter, setter
    }

    @Entity(naming = NamingType.SNAKE_LOWER_CASE)
    public class Address {
      @Id Integer id;
      String street;

      // getter, setter
    }

In entity classes, association properties must be annotated with ``@Association``.
These properties can be linked using ``@AssociationLinker``.

Using an aggregate strategy
---------------------------

``DepartmentAggregateStrategy`` is used by specifying it in the ``aggregateStrategy`` element of ``@Select``:

.. code-block:: java

    @Dao
    interface DepartmentDao {
      @Select(aggregateStrategy = DepartmentAggregateStrategy.class)
      Department selectById(Integer id);
    }

The ``selectById`` method requires a SELECT statement like the following:

.. code-block:: sql

    select
        d.id as d_id,
        d.name as d_name,
        a.id as a_id,
        a.street as a_street,
        e.id as e_id,
        e.name as e_name,
        e.department_id as e_department_id,
        e.address_id as e_address_id
    from
        department d
        left outer join
        employee e on (d.id = e.department_id)
        left outer join
        address a on (e.address_id = a.id)
    where
        d.id = /* id */0

.. note::

    The SELECT list must include the IDs of all entities that form the aggregate.

Column aliasing rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Table aliases must match those defined in ``DepartmentAggregateStrategy``.
- Column aliases must begin with the table alias followed by an underscore (``_``).
  For example, ``d.id`` should be aliased as ``d_id`` and ``e.id`` as ``e_id``.

Using the expansion directive
-----------------------------

By using the :ref:`expansion directive <expand>`, the above SELECT statement can be written more concisely:

.. code-block:: sql

    select
        /*%expand*/*
    from
        department d
        left outer join
        employee e on (d.id = e.department_id)
        left outer join
        address a on (e.address_id = a.id)
    where
        d.id = /* id */0


How expansion works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``/*%expand*/*`` directive automatically expands into a column list following predefined aliasing rules.
- By default, all columns from all tables are included in the result set.

To selectively expand only specific tables, pass a comma-separated list of table aliases:

.. code-block:: sql

    select
        /*%expand "e, d" */*,
        a.id as a_id,
        a.street as a_street
    from
        department d
        left outer join
        employee e on (d.id = e.department_id)
        left outer join
        address a on (e.address_id = a.id)
    where
        d.id = /* id */0

- Here, only columns from tables ``e`` (``employee``) and ``d`` (``department``) are expanded.
- The columns from table ``a`` (``address``) are explicitly specified.
