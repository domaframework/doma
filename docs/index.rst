Welcome to Doma
=====================

Doma is a database access framework for Java with several notable strengths:

* It checks and generates source code at compile time using annotation processing.
* It supports associations between entities.
* It offers a type-safe Criteria API.
* It includes SQL templates, known as “two-way SQL.”
* It runs independently, without relying on any other libraries.

This document consists of following sections:

* `User Documentation`_
