# JavaDoc Improvements Summary

## Overview
This report summarizes the improvements made to JavaDoc comments in the Doma framework's codebase, focusing on grammar, clarity, and terminology consistency.

## Files Modified
I've improved JavaDoc comments in over 40 files within the `doma-core` project, excluding classes under the `internal` package. Key files include:

### Core Annotations
1. `Version.java` - Fixed verb tense in class description
2. `GeneratedValue.java` - Improved method description clarity
3. `Entity.java` - Fixed typo ("entity lister class" â†’ "entity listener class")
4. `Dao.java` - Improved method description clarity
5. `Domain.java` - Enhanced clarity of domain class description
6. `Table.java` - Enhanced parameter descriptions

### SQL Operations
7. `Select.java` - Enhanced operation description and parameter documentation
8. `Insert.java` - Improved parameter descriptions
9. `Update.java` - Clarified operation behavior
10. `Delete.java` - Enhanced operation description
11. `BatchInsert.java` - Improved operation description and parameter clarity
12. `BatchUpdate.java` - Added more context about batch operations
13. `MultiInsert.java` - Enhanced operation description

### JDBC Components
14. `SqlFile.java` - Added comprehensive class description
15. `SqlNode.java` - Clarified purpose in SQL processing system
16. `SqlNodeVisitor.java` - Improved visitor pattern description
17. `Sql.java` - Enhanced interface description
18. `SqlParameter.java` - Added context about parameter binding
19. `SqlKind.java` - Clarified enum purpose
20. `SqlLogType.java` - Improved log format descriptions
21. `JdbcLogger.java` - Enhanced interface description

### Entity Components
22. `Column.java` - Clarified property descriptions
23. `Id.java` - Improved primary key description
24. `TenantId.java` - Added context about multi-tenant applications
25. `Association.java` - Enhanced relationship description
26. `Embeddable.java` - Clarified purpose of embeddable classes
27. `OriginalStates.java` - Improved description of partial updates

### Meta Annotations
28. `EntityField.java` - Added missing class-level JavaDoc
29. `DaoMethod.java` - Added missing class-level JavaDoc
30. `EntityTypeImplementation.java` - Added missing class-level JavaDoc
31. `DomainTypeImplementation.java` - Added missing class-level JavaDoc
32. `DaoImplementation.java` - Added missing class-level JavaDoc

## Types of Improvements

### Grammar Corrections
- Fixed verb tense consistency (using "Indicates" instead of "Indicate")
- Corrected article usage ("a" vs "an")
- Fixed typos and spelling errors
- Improved sentence structure and readability

### Clarity Improvements
- Added more context to class and method descriptions
- Clarified parameter descriptions by explaining their purpose
- Used more precise language to describe behaviors
- Added cross-references between related components using `@see` tags
- Expanded abbreviated explanations with more details

### Terminology Consistency
- Ensured consistent use of terms like "entity", "dao", "operation", etc.
- Aligned terminology with RST documentation in the `domaframework/doma-docs` repository
- Used consistent phrasing for similar concepts across different files

## Build Verification
The build command `./gradlew :doma-core:build` was run successfully, confirming that the JavaDoc improvements did not break any functionality. All 1358 tests passed. The code formatting was also verified with `./gradlew spotlessApply`.

## Potential Issues
No significant issues were encountered during the improvement process. The codebase has generally good documentation, but some classes lacked comprehensive JavaDoc comments, which have now been addressed.

## Next Steps
1. Continue reviewing and improving more files in the `doma-core` project
2. Document any terminology inconsistencies between JavaDoc and RST documentation
3. Wait for further instructions before creating a PR
